These projects focus on challenges at the intersection between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber-Security, including security for AI and AI for security, aiming for better and more widespread adoption of trusted and secure AI systems. </p> 
                <p>We are particularly interested in discussing recent achievements and future initiatives to address the fundamental security problem of guaranteeing safety, transparency, and robustness in neural-based architectures. We will have invited talks, poster presentations, and a roundtable discussion regarding SafeAI.</p>
                <p>Participants will leave having a better understanding of enabling system designers to specify essential conceptual/behavioral properties of neural-based systems, verify them, and thus safeguard the system against unpredictable behavior and attacks. Therefore, we will foster the dialogue between contemporary explainable neural models and full-stack neural software verification.</p> 
                <p>The event will occur on July 4th in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, located in the Kilburn Building, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL. The talks will occur in LT1.4, the poster session in Atlas 1, and the lunch and drinks in the Mercury room. These venues are all located on the first floor of the Kilburn building.</p>

                                    The use of domain-specific private data can bring significant value to ML models, but also requires us to ensure that this data is adequately protected, even from users of the model. Privacy-preserving machine learning has been the focus of a significant body of research, with several mature tools and techniques now available. However, in real-world deployments, several practical questions may still arise: What specific threats are we mitigating? What level of privacy is sufficient? How do we know we have achieved the desired privacy level? In this talk, I will discuss recent work on the theme of evaluating privacy in ML, ranging from the use of 'Privacy Games' to formalize and reason about specific risks, through to techniques for empirically estimating the level of privacy achieved.

                                    While the need for safe AI systems is clear, establishing what it means for an AI system to be safe is more difficult. First, how do we encode high-level safety requirements in strict mathematical terms? Second, how do we check that these requirements are met? Offering a (partial) answer to these questions will take us through a journey across several fields: natural language processing, metamorphic software testing, quantised neural networks, equivalence verification and privacy-preserving machine learning.

				<p>
                                Verification of machine learning models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is known to be a hard problem. In particular, many known neural network verification methods that work for computer vision and other numeric datasets do not work for NLP. In this talk, we present technical reasons that underlie this problem. Based on this analysis, we propose practical methods and heuristics for preparing NLP datasets and models in a way that renders them amenable to known verification methods. We implement these methods as a Python library that links to the neural network verifier Marabou. We perform evaluation of the tool using an NLP dataset R-U-A-Robot suggested as a benchmark for verifying legally critical NLP applications. We hope that, thanks to its general applicability, this work will open novel possibilities for including NLP verification problems into neural network verification competitions, and will draw attention to NLP verification problems within this community.

                                <p>
                                    Owing to the non-convexity of the associated optimisation problem, neural network verification algorithms do not scale to the network architectures commonly employed in vision or language applications. It is therefore common to replace the problem with an approximation (incomplete methods), providing a formal guarantee on a subset of the target verification properties. While incomplete methods may be relatively inexpensive, they hardly provide any positive answer on standard-trained networks. The accuracy of incomplete verifiers is greatly increased if networks are explicitly trained for verifiability, but these improvements come at a large computational cost, and at the expense of standard performance. In this talk, we present relatively efficient and conceptually simple methods to train networks for verifiability, and outline their potential applications to models employed on language tasks.

                                    When a user faces a security threat such as receiving a phishing email or visiting a watering hole website, there are often visual and behavioural cues that can raise their suspicion, and there are known cyber hygiene measures they can follow. This is not the case for AI enabled Internet of Things devices such as those found in a modern smart home especially where their AI is the target of an attack. In this talk, we will discuss whether and how users can be involved in the process of protecting themselves, not only in prevention but also in detection, diagnosis and response to an AI security breach.
