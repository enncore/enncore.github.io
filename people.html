Dr. Cordeiro is the Arm Centre of Excellence Director at UoM; he also leads the Trusted Digital Systems cluster at the Centre for Digital Trust and Society. He is also affiliated with the Formal Methods Group at UoM. Dr. Cordeiro has implemented various tools used to verify safety and security properties in significant industrial programs written in Java, C/C++, and CUDA. Among those are ESBMC, an SMT-based model checker for C/C++/Qt and CUDA, and JBMC, a SAT-based model checker for Java bytecode. In the last ten years, he also won 28 awards from international software verification and testing competitions held as part of ETAPS at TACAS 2012-2021 and FASE 2020-2021. Dr. Cordeiro's industrial research collaborators include Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, TP Vision, Intel, and ARM. His tools have been applied to find real security vulnerabilities in large-scale software systems. He has a proven track record of securing research funding from Samsung, Nokia Institute of Technology, Motorola, CAPES, CNPq, FAPEAM, British Council, EPSRC, and Royal Society. He leads one large EPSRC project concerning verifiable and explainable secure AI. He is Co-I on three others about software security and automated reasoning, with a portfolio of approximately 5.4m GBP.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px;" align="justify"><a href="http://andrefreitas.org/" target="_blank">André Freitas</a> is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where he leads the AI Systems Lab. Dr. Freitas works at the interface between latent and explicit semantic representation and inference. His works are the state-of-the-art in contextual Open Information / Knowledge Graph Extraction, sentence splitting. Dr. Freitas has pioneered explainable reasoning approaches, which are also the state-of-the-art in the field. Dr. Freitas introduced explainability into Text Entailment, the use of hybrid distributional-symbolic representations for Natural Language Inference and semantic parsing over large and heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Dr. Freitas worked as a project coordinator (InnovateUK IAA BP, RS Explainable QA) and technical leader (H2020 SSIX, H2020 MARIO, FP7 SIFEM) in NLP projects.</p>

Mustafa</a> is a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester. He is a Co-I of a multi-disciplinary FWO-SBO project on secure and privacy-friendly energy trading, the SNIPPET project (S007619N), where he leads the work package for designing algorithms for secure and verifiable biding, billing and market/user/grid behavior modeling based on AI/ML algorithms. Over the past few years, Dr. Mustafa has worked on several multi-disciplinary projects, including Smart Grid Security (EPSRC and Toshiba TREL), SAGA (InnoEnergy) and DiskMan (imec). His work won awards and recognition, including Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellowship (University of Manchester, 2017), Best Student Video Award (IEEE SmartGridComm 2017), Best Paper Award (SECURWARE 2017) and shortlisted for Distinguished Achievement Award as Postgraduate Research Student of the Year (University of Manchester, 2015). He currently acts as an expert in the IEC/SYC/WG3 EC Smart Energy Roadmap.</p>

		<img alt="Huang" src="files/xiaoweihuang.jpg" style="width: 10vw; min-width: 30px;">
		<p style="font-size:16px;" align="justify"><a href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/" target="_blank">Xiaowei Huang</a> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. Dr Huang is an international lead on the verification and testing of neural networks. His paper on safety verification has attracted 240+ citations. The new research direction started from this paper has attracted significant attention, e.g., deep learning expert Dr Ian Goodfellow wrote a blog post dedicated to discuss this direction and the paper. Additional to the verification approaches, Dr Huang is also leading on the testing of deep neural networks. His team is the first to propose the MC/DC variants of test coverage metrics for neural networks and a concolic (i.e., combination of concrete and symbolic execution) testing approach for neural networks. Dr Huang is the PI of two Dstl projects on Test Metrics for AI worth £426k, and is a co-I of one of the UK hubs of robotics and AI for extreme environments on Offshore Robotics for Certification of Asset, leading the research on the certification of deep learning.</p>
